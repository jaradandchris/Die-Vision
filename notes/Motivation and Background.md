# Motivation and background for the project
I started playing Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) a year ago. I have been wanting to play for a long time, I even had my own collection of dice required to play the game. However, I play D&D over the internet using something called a virtual tabletop, or VTT. There are scores of virtual tabletop applications to choose from like Roll20, Foundry, and Shard. The one I have been using for the last year is Fantasy Grounds. One feature that is common among virtual tabletop programs is dice rolling. Players roll dice virtually using realistic simulated dice.

## Role of the dice in D&D
Dice rolling is a part of Dungeons & Dragons and other tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) for a number of reasons.

- Dice provide a fair and impartial way to resolve actions in the game. This is important because it helps to ensure that the game is not biased in favor of any one player or character.
- Dice can be used to represent a wide range of different things in the game, from the outcome of a battle to the success of a skill check. This makes them a very versatile tool for the Dungeon Master (DM).
- Dice add an element of chance and unpredictability to the game. This contributes to the excitement and tension of the game. You never know what the outcome of a dice roll will be, and the outcome of a dice roll can have a significant impact on the game.
- Dice can add a sense of physicality and excitement to the game. Rolling dice can be a very satisfying experience, and it can help to immerse the players in the game world.

#### Why do virtual tabletop applications go through the trouble of creating animated simulations of dice?
#### How are the simulations of dice rolling simulated, is it purely visual?
#### How is the sensory experience of rolling dice in the real world different from the experience of rolling dice using a virtual tabletop program?

Virtual tabletop (VTT) applications have become increasingly popular in recent years, and many D&D and RPG players now use them to play their games online. VTTs offer a number of advantages over traditional tabletop gaming, such as the ability to share maps and character sheets, and the ability to roll dice virtually.

Why do VTTs go through the trouble of creating animated simulations of dice?

There are a few reasons why VTTs go through the trouble of creating animated simulations of dice. First, it can be more visually appealing than simply displaying the results of a dice roll. Second, it can help to create a more immersive experience for the players. Third, it can help to prevent cheating.

How are the simulations of dice rolling simulated?

VTTs use a variety of algorithms to simulate the rolling of dice. Some algorithms use a random number generator to produce a random number between 1 and the number of sides on the die. Other algorithms use a physics simulation to model the rolling of a real die.

How is the sensory experience of rolling dice in the real world different from the experience of rolling dice using a virtual tabletop program?

There are a few key differences between the sensory experience of rolling dice in the real world and the experience of rolling dice using a virtual tabletop program. First, the physical act of rolling dice can be more satisfying than simply clicking a button. Second, the sound of dice rolling can be more immersive than the sound of dice rolling on a computer screen. Third, the tactile sensation of dice rolling can be more satisfying than the visual sensation of dice rolling on a computer screen.

Overall, dice rolling is an essential part of D&D and other RPGs, and VTTs have done a good job of replicating the experience of rolling dice in the real world. However, there are some key differences between the two experiences, and some players may still prefer to roll dice in person.
